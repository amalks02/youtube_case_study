Scenario Based Questions
Scenario 1:
An entertainment company wants to analyse the behaviour of users who signed up for a premium streaming subscription in the past year. They want to track how many of these users renew their subscription in the months following their initial sign-up.
Question 1:
How would you calculate the monthly retention rate for each cohort of users who signed up in different months?
Hint: Group users by the month they signed up (cohort), and calculate the percentage of users who renew their subscription in subsequent months.
Question 2:
If you notice that users tend to drop off after the third month, what strategies would you propose to improve long-term retention?
Hint: Consider offering special discounts, exclusive content, or personalised recommendations to keep users engaged after the initial months.

Scenario 2:
A gaming company is testing two different tutorial designs for new users in its mobile game. Version A is a brief, text-based tutorial, while Version B is an interactive, step-by-step guide. They want to see which tutorial leads to better user retention and higher conversion rates (i.e., users making in-game purchases).
Question 1:
Design an A/B test to evaluate which tutorial version leads to better retention and conversion rates. What metrics would you use to measure success?
Hint: Track retention (e.g., percentage of users who return after one week) and conversion rates (e.g., percentage of users who make their first purchase within 7 days).
Question 2:
If Version B (interactive guide) shows higher conversion rates but slightly lower retention, how would you balance these results when making a recommendation to the business?
Hint: Consider the long-term value of higher conversions versus the potential impact of reduced retention. You might suggest refining Version B to improve retention without sacrificing conversions.
